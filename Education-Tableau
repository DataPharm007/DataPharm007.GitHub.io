## The state of Massachusetts High Schools Report

### Introduction:

The state of Massachusetts wants to provide a report to the school board on the state of the system. In that report the superintendent wants 3 major questions answered.
To help answered the questions I gathered the needed reports from the states' Department of Education and used Tableau to help visualize what the data holds.

The report addresses class size impact on college admissions, 4th-grade math performance across all districts, and the schools struggling the most.

### The Task:
- How does class size affect college admission?
- What are the top math schools in the state?
- What schools are struggling the most?

### The Data, cleaning, and Transformation:

All Null values were removed from the data used in visualization.

### The Discovery:

Key findings include class size not strongly linked to college attendance, most schools meeting the 4th grade MACS math benchmarks, and identification of the bottom 10 struggling high schools.
