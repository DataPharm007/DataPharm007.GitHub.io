## The Tale of Data Planet Excelos and the Kingdom of Profitshire

### Introduction:
**Project description:** Once upon a time, in a faraway galaxy, there was a curious little planet known as Excelos. Unlike other planets, Excelos was not made of rock or gas but of dataâ€”beautiful streams of numbers, shimmering charts, and pulsating graphs. At the heart of Excelos was a mighty kingdom known as Profitshire (aka iFood), ruled by a wise and somewhat eccentric King, known to all as King Marginus (aka The CEO).
