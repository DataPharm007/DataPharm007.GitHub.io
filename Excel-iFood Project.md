## The Tale of Data Planet Excelos and the Kingdom of Profitshire

### Introduction:
**Project description:** Once upon a time, in a faraway galaxy, there was a curious little planet known as Excelos. Unlike other planets, Excelos was not made of rock or gas but of data—beautiful streams of numbers, shimmering charts, and pulsating graphs. At the heart of Excelos was a mighty kingdom known as Profitshire (aka iFood), ruled by a wise and somewhat eccentric King, known to all as King Marginus (aka The CEO).

### Problem:

For many years, Profitshire flourished, and its coffers overflowed with gold (commonly referred to as "customer spending” in ancient texts). But as time passed (3 years), Profitshire found itself losing gold despite numerous peace offerings (called "campaigns" in their dialect). By the time the 6th campaign ended, King Marginus realized that mere goodwill was not enough to reverse the trend and boost the kingdom's riches.

In his moment of desperation, King Marginus called for the only person who could save the day: the legendary Captain Analysis (aka Me) with my ability to transform numbers into actionable strategies that has saved many a kingdom from ruin.
