In this assigned project, I looked for the reason(s) why iFood, a Brazil food delivery services was incurring loss despite several campaigns and having 83% of the market share. Is it that they have reached their market cap? Is it that the wrong demographics were being targeted in the campaign, or is it that the campaign missed the mark on what people are really needing? Come explore with me.

In this case study, I analyzed the State of Massachusetts education data. The state of Massachusetts wants to provide a report to the school board on the state of the system. In that report the superintendent wants 3 major questions answered.

- What schools are struggling the most?
- How does class size affect college admission?
- What are the top math schools in the state?
